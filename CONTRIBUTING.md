## CONTRIBUTING.md

This document outlines how you can contribute to the CreatorLink project!

We welcome contributions of all kinds to help expand and improve this database. Whether you're a developer or a content creator yourself, your help is valuable.

**How to Contribute**

Here's how you can get involved:

**1. Adding or Updating Creator Information**

* **Fork the Repository:** Head over to GitHub and fork this repository to your own account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the main project.
* **Create a Feature Branch:** Each new creator should get its own branch e.g `add-creator-dominik`. Non-creator pull requests should be given a meaningful name.
* **Edit the JSON File:** Open the correct continent your creator is based in e.g `europe.json` file and make the necessary changes. This could involve adding a new creator, updating existing information, or correcting any inaccuracies.
* **Verify Your Changes:**  Double-check the information you added or updated is accurate and consistent. 
* **Submit a Pull Request:**  Once you're happy with your changes, push your edits to your forked repository and create a pull request. This will send your proposed changes to the main project for review.

**Additional Notes:**

* When adding a new creator, please include information from as many platforms as possible (Steam, Discord, Twitch, Youtube, etc.).
* Be sure to follow the existing formatting within the JSON file for consistency.
* Make sure the creator is somewhat known and actually deserves a spot in CreatorLink.

**2. Reporting Issues**

If you encounter any issues with the Creator Database, you can report them by opening an issue on this repository. While submitting bug reports, please provide as much detail as possible, such as:

* The part of the data with which you encountered a problem
* Any source of the resource that is out of date

**3. Code Contributions**

If you're a developer and have ideas for improving the codebase, feel free to submit pull requests with your proposed changes. We encourage clean and well-documented code.

**What We Look For in Contributions**

* **Accuracy:** Ensure all information added is verified and up-to-date. 
* **Consistency:** Follow the existing formatting within the JSON file. 
* **Clarity:**  Clearly communicate the changes you made in your pull request description.

Pull requests that do not meet our quality standards may be closed without explanation and/or given a `low quality' label.

**Thank You!**

We appreciate your interest in contributing to CreatorLink! Your contributions will help keep this resource valuable for developers and content creators.
